# menu-project

## About this project
The focus on this application was using JavaScript to dynamically update/add/delete content from a menu. This would be necessary for a e-commerce store or, in this case, the menu to a restaurant. Setting up the framework for items using JSON and dynamically adding content to a card holding a menu item. The top menu type buttons filter menu items based on the type of meal.
